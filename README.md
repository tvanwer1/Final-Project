# Data601 Final Project - BeerAdvocate Beer Reviews Analysis :beer:

## • Overview

In this project I will implement tools and techniques learned in Data601

### Introduction

In this project we will be working with beer reviews data. This is the dataset disccused in the talk " How to hire and test for data skills: A one-size-fits-all interview kit" from https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny-2017/public/schedule/detail/59542. This files contains around 1.5 Millions reviews of Beer from BeerAdvocates. The data isn't perfect which allows for opportunites to showcase subject knowledge.

Scenario: As we try to predict overall favorability on beer styles; we suppose we are working for brewery/retailer. As a result of this project, we will give them suggested beer styles to add to production/marketing campaigns based on ratings from user reviews.

## Goals

Goals in this project:

-Identify which beer styles generate the strongest positive reviews

-Train a model on beer style with logistic regression

## Motivation & Background

Beer has been a potable for centuries. My undergraduate thesis utilized SPSS & tasting data from a Beers of the World course being offered. At that time, craft beers were a niche segment of the overall market but with devote followers. As the craft beer market continues to increase market share, breweries would be interested in data on what styles, ABV %, names, aroma profile, appearance, palate, taste consumers prefer. Retailers also would want to know that data to assist in inventory, marketing campaigns and building consumer loyalty.
