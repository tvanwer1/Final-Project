### Introduction

In this project we will be working with a beer review data. This is the dataset disccused in the talk " How to hire and test for data skills: A one-size-fits-all interview kit" from https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny-2017/public/schedule/detail/59542.

## Goals

## Motivation & Background

Beer has been a potable for centuries. My undergraduate thesis utilized SPSS & tasting data from a Beers of the World course being offered. At that time, craft beers were a niche segment of the overall market but with devote followers. As the craft beer market continues to increase market share, breweries would be interested in data on what styles, ABV %, names, aroma profile, appearance, palate, taste consumers prefer. Retailers also would want to know that data to assist in inventory, marketing campaigns and building consumer loyalty.
